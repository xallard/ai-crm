# customer_feedback_analyzer.py
# Script for analyzing customer feedback using SpaCy in AI-CRM

# For the AI-CRM project, we can develop a fictitious Python script focused on using SpaCy, a popular natural language processing library, for analyzing customer feedback and interactions. This script, perhaps named customer_feedback_analyzer.py, will be dedicated to parsing, understanding, and extracting insights from customer communication. This file would be suitably placed in the customer-analytics module of the project.

# In this script:

# The CustomerFeedbackAnalyzer class handles the analysis of customer feedback.
# SpaCy is used for NLP tasks, including tokenization and possibly sentiment analysis.
# A simple keyword extraction method is demonstrated, using token frequency. For more advanced applications, additional techniques like TF-IDF could be integrated.
# The sentiment analysis part is a placeholder, where a more complex sentiment analysis model or method can be implemented.
# This script, as part of the customer-analytics module in the AI-CRM project, would play a vital role in extracting valuable insights from customer feedback, contributing to a more refined and responsive CRM strategy.
